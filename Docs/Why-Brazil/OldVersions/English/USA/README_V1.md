# Why Brazil?

Rio De Janeiro (the city that is themed around Angry Birds Rio) is in Brazil. It wouldn't be a legal risk to call this project LibreFlock Rio, but that wouldn't be too original, so I chose LibreFlock Brazil, as I want to represent more than just 1 city.

Brazil is home to 60% of the Amazon Rainforest, the most diverse rainforest in the world. This project will serve as a fun game, but will also raise awareness for deforestation and global warming, although this won't be shoved in the users face (this would take some fun out of the game)

Brazil isn't a bad country either, it has been in parts of its history, but it is a good country as of 2023 January. This project will additionally celebrate Brazil and its culture.
